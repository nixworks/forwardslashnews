A quick express sample.

## Testing
Uses JEST
``` npm run test ```
``` npm run test:watch ```
``` npm run test:coverage ```

## About
This is about as far as I can get setting up a project on an airplane with horrible GoGo in flight internet.

There is not a database for this app as it is mocked from some Worpress data. It also uses Faker
to add the main content. This prevents me from stripping or using the RAW html in Worpress.

The controllers are all 98% the same. This is not what would happen in the real world as it would either 
perform a different action or would be extracted into "Base" components. 

## Why 
Mostly a quick a dirty sample. Also an excuse to try the new and improved JEST testing library.
